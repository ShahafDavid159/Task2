I, I just woke up from a dream

Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means

But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow

So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through

I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore

'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you

Oh-oh, oh
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
I'd wanna be next to you

"Die with a Smile" is a song by American singer-songwriters Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.
It was released on August 16, 2024, through Interscope Records.
Gaga and Mars wrote and produced the track alongside Dernst "D'Mile"
Emile II and Andrew Watt while James Fauntleroy provided additional songwriting.
The collaboration was a result of Mars inviting Gaga to his studio where he had been working on new music.
He presented the track in progress to her and the duo finished writing and recording the song the same day.
In the song, Gaga and Mars express a powerful longing to be with a loved one,
highlighting the urgency and depth of their love 
in the face of uncertainty and potential endings.

Musically, the soft rock-leaning track has been compared to Gaga's 2016 album Joanne and her own 2018 release,
"Shallow", and Mars' work with Anderson .Paak as part of the Silk Sonic project.
An accompanying music video directed by Mars and Daniel Ramos showing both singers
performing the song on a retro stage set was released simultaneously alongside the track.
Music critics lauded both singers' vocals and chemistry.
"Die with a Smile" is currently nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group
Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. It was also a commercial success,
reaching number one in Belgium, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel,
Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Suriname, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
