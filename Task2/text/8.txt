Oh-oh, oh
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
I'd wanna be next to you
