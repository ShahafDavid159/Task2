Musically, the soft rock-leaning track has been compared to Gaga's 2016 album Joanne and her own 2018 release,
"Shallow", and Mars' work with Anderson .Paak as part of the Silk Sonic project.
An accompanying music video directed by Mars and Daniel Ramos showing both singers
performing the song on a retro stage set was released simultaneously alongside the track.
Music critics lauded both singers' vocals and chemistry.
"Die with a Smile" is currently nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group
Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. It was also a commercial success,
reaching number one in Belgium, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel,
Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Suriname, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
